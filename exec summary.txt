The aim of the elaboration phase was to have a working model of what was recognised as the critical, core, risky and difficult use cases. Specifically this would allow a person to: 
•	Open the application on a mobile device 
•	Download the latest question pool 
•	Create an account and sign in using that account 
•	Play through a game 
•	Have their score recorded on the global score board 
•	Allow registered users to submit questions to the question pool.
We are proud to say we have we have an application that can execute each of these requirements.
There is still a great deal of work remaining but at this stage the primary architecture is in place. For example currently a user can only create Let’s Quiz accounts, the intention is to allow social media accounts, like Facebook and Google to be linked directly to Let’s Quiz. There is also expansion planned for question submission and tracking as well as allowing for multiple question categories. 
The largest work item planned for implementation is the expansion of the single player game into a multiplayer game. While this item is deemed important to the final product it is not critical and the application could operate without being multiplayer. This is absolutely not the intention and for that reason the expansion of the game to incorporate multiplayer functionality is one of the first work items planned.
